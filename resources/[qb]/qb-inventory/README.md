üì¶ QB Inventory
This script is coded to run smoothly when your inventories change without any problems.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
1. >Update Config File:
If you are using qb-core, you need to change e.g-inventory export names to qb-inventory. Otherwise it will not work properly

Update the exports below in the corresponding files and any other script you may have which use qb-inventory export

qb-core > client > functions.lua
qb-core > server > functions.lua
qb-core > server > player.lua

2. >Installing Requirements:
You need to interact or qb-target or ox_target script for the targeting system

üöÄ Updates
The script will be continuously updated and new features will continue to be added.

‚ùóÔ∏è Important Notes
1. It is recommended not to restart the script while the server is active.

2. It is recommended to check the config file several times before running it. If you need help with the config, please make sure to ask in a respectful way.

3. If you are already using qb-inventory, you do not need to make any changes to your code to organize your inventory
